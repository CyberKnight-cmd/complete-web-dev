# **Video 4: Getting Started with HTML Using CodePen**

---

## 61. Why We’re Using Basic HTML First

* At the start, we **won’t build full HTML documents**
* No deep structure yet (`<!DOCTYPE>`, `<head>`, etc.)
* Focus is on:

  * Understanding **HTML tags**
  * Seeing **immediate results**

👉 This removes setup friction and lets you **learn by seeing**.

---

## 62. What Is CodePen?

* **CodePen (codepen.io)** is an online **coding playground**
* Used to:

  * Write small code snippets
  * Instantly preview results
  * Avoid local setup complexity

Think of it as:

> A sandbox for experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

---

## 63. What Is a “Pen”?

* A **Pen** = a small project inside CodePen
* Each pen can contain:

  * HTML
  * CSS
  * JavaScript

Features:

* Editable anytime
* Shareable
* Forkable (copy & modify)
* Real-time updates

---

## 64. Why CodePen Is Perfect for Beginners

CodePen allows you to:

* Skip boilerplate setup
* Write code immediately
* See results **live**
* Focus on learning, not configuration

👉 Ideal for **learning concepts**, not deployment.

---

## 65. Real-Time Rendering (Very Important)

* Any change you make:

  * Updates **instantly**
  * No refresh needed

This creates a **tight feedback loop**:

> Write → See → Understand → Fix

---

## 66. Creating a Free CodePen Account

Ways to sign up:

* Email
* GitHub
* Twitter
* Facebook

Basic requirements:

* Name
* Username
* Email
* Password

👉 Free account is **more than enough** for this course.

---

## 67. CodePen Interface Overview

When you open a new pen, you see:

### Top Panes

* **HTML pane**
* **CSS pane**
* **JavaScript pane**

### Bottom / Side Pane

* **Preview / Output area**

This output shows:

* Exactly what the browser would render

---

## 68. For Now: HTML Only

* This week, we only use:

  * **HTML pane**
* CSS and JavaScript panes:

  * Can be resized
  * Can be hidden
  * Can be restored later

👉 Focus = **structure**, not styling or behavior.

---

## 69. Writing Your First HTML in CodePen

Example:

```html
<h1>Hello World</h1>
```

What happens:

* As soon as you type it
* It appears **instantly** in the preview pane

This confirms:

* HTML tags are working
* Browser is rendering correctly

---

## 70. Tags Recap (Early Reinforcement)

Example:

```html
<h1>Heading</h1>
```

* `<h1>` → opening tag
* `</h1>` → closing tag
* Content goes **inside**

👉 Tags tell the browser **what the content is**.

---

## 71. Naming Your Pen (Good Practice)

In **Settings → General**:

* Add:

  * Title (e.g., `example01`)
  * Description (optional)
  * Tags (optional)

This helps:

* Organization
* Future reference
* Sharing

---

## 72. HTML Settings (What to Ignore for Now)

* HTML preprocessors ❌
* Auto-generated classes ❌
* Head tag injection ❌

👉 These are **advanced** and not needed yet.

---

## 73. Behavior Settings (Important Ones)

In **Settings → Behavior**:

Recommended:

* ✅ Enable **Auto Save** (every 30 seconds)
* ❌ Leave auto-format off (for now)

Why auto save matters:

* Prevents losing work
* Especially useful while learning

---

## 74. Editor Settings: Indentation (Critical Habit)

Indentation:

* Makes nested code readable
* Helps spot structure errors

CodePen:

* Automatically indents nested tags

Example:

```html
<div>
  <p>Text</p>
</div>
```

---

## 75. Customizing Indentation Size

In **Editor Settings**:

* Indentation:

  * Spaces or tabs
  * Default: 2 spaces
  * Can increase (e.g., 4 or 6)

👉 This is **personal preference**, not a rule.

---

## 76. Indentation = Visual Structure

More indentation:

* More visual clarity
* Easier to understand nesting

Especially helpful when:

* Pages become complex
* Elements are deeply nested

---

## 77. Layout View Options

You can change:

* Code on top, preview below
* Code on left, preview on right

This helps:

* Match your screen size
* Improve focus

👉 Layout does **not** affect code.

---

## 78. Pinning, Liking, and Saving Pens

* **Pin**: Keep easy access
* **Like (❤️)**: Save others’ work
* Mostly useful for:

  * Exploring community examples
  * Learning from others

---

## 79. “Your Work” Section

* Shows **all your pens**
* Acts like:

  * Your personal project library

Example:

* `example01`
* Future exercises
* Practice files

---

## 80. Forking Other People’s Pens

**Forking** means:

* Copy someone else’s pen
* Save it to your account
* Modify it freely

This is how developers:

* Learn patterns
* Experiment safely
* Customize examples

---

## 81. Fork Example Workflow

1. Open a public pen
2. Click **Fork**
3. Rename it
4. Modify code
5. Save

👉 Original remains untouched.

---

## 82. Deleting Pens (Clean Workspace)

* You can delete any pen you own
* Confirmation required (to prevent mistakes)

Good practice:

* Remove unused experiments
* Keep workspace tidy

---

## 83. CodePen Account Settings

In **Settings**:

* Upload profile image
* Add profile links
* Manage preferences

Not required for learning — optional.

---

## 84. Editor Preferences (Very Important)

You can customize:

* Theme (dark / light)
* Syntax highlighting
* Font family
* Font size

These improve:

* Readability
* Focus
* Comfort during long sessions

---

## 85. Syntax Highlighting Meaning (Preview)

Colors represent:

* Elements (tags)
* Attributes
* Attribute values
* Text content

👉 Colors help you **visually parse HTML**.

---

## 86. Choosing a Theme

* Dark themes → less eye strain (for many)
* Light themes → familiar paper-like feel

Instructor uses:

* **High Contrast Dark**

You can choose **any**.

---

## 87. Font Size & Font Family

* Increase font size for clarity
* Choose a font you’re comfortable with

Example:

* Monaco
* Consolas
* Fira Code

👉 Comfort > aesthetics.

---

## 88. Turning OFF Emmet (Very Important for Beginners)

* **Disable Emmet**
* Reason:

  * Emmet auto-expands shortcuts
  * Can confuse beginners
  * You must learn real HTML first

We’ll revisit Emmet **later**.

---

## 89. Why We Don’t Use Pro Features

* Pro version exists
* Adds extra tools
* **Not needed** for learning HTML

Free account = sufficient.

---

## 90. Exploring Community Pens

In **Trending / Explore**:

* See advanced pens
* Many use:

  * CSS
  * JavaScript
  * Animations

You can:

* View code
* Learn ideas
* Fork for practice

---

## 91. CodePen as a Learning Playground

Key advantage:

* No full HTML boilerplate
* No file system
* No server
* Just learning

Perfect for:

* Trying tags
* Making mistakes
* Understanding structure

---

## 92. What We’ll Do This Week

* Use CodePen as:

  * A sandbox
  * A testing ground
* Learn:

  * Basic HTML tags
  * Structure concepts

---

## 93. Required Action (Important)

✅ Sign up for a **free CodePen account**
✅ Familiarize yourself with:

* HTML pane
* Preview pane
* Settings

Once done:

* You’re ready to write HTML.

---
