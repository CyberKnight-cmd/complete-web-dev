# **Video 2: What Makes Up a Web Page (The Three-Layer Model)**

---

## 24. The Three Core Layers of a Web Page (Big Picture)

A typical web page is built using **three distinct but connected layers**:

1. **Content Layer** – *What the page says*
2. **Presentation Layer** – *How the page looks*
3. **Behavior Layer** – *How the page acts*

👉 These layers **work together** to deliver the full user experience.

---

## 25. Content Layer (HTML – Structure & Meaning)

### What It Is

* The **content layer** is the **information you see** on the page:

  * Text
  * Headings
  * Images
  * Links
  * Forms

### Technology Used

* **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**

### Role of HTML

* Provides the **structural foundation** of a web page
* Instructs browsers **how content is organized**
* Describes *what each piece of content is*, not how it looks

👉 HTML is:

* Common to **every website and web application**
* A **cornerstone technology** of the web

### Example (Pure Content)

```html
<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>This is a web page.</p>
<a href="#">Click here</a>
```

No colors. No animations. Just **meaning and structure**.

---

## 26. HTML as a Core Web Technology

For decades, HTML has been:

* One of the **three pillars of the World Wide Web**
* Used universally across browsers and platforms

The three pillars:

1. HTML – Content
2. CSS – Presentation
3. JavaScript – Behavior

👉 Without HTML, there is **nothing for CSS or JavaScript to work on**.

---

## 27. Presentation Layer (CSS – Visual Styling)

### What It Is

* The **presentation layer** controls **how content looks**

Handled by:

* **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**

### What CSS Controls

* Colors 🎨
* Layout 📐
* Fonts & typography ✍️
* Spacing
* Shadows, borders, animations (visual)

### Example (CSS Styling)

```css
h1 {
  color: blue;
  font-family: Arial;
}
```

👉 The **content stays the same**, only the appearance changes.

---

## 28. Why CSS Is Separate from HTML

Key idea:

* You can **change the entire look of a website**
* Without touching the HTML structure

This separation:

* Makes maintenance easier
* Encourages clean design
* Allows multiple visual themes for the same content

**Mental Hook:**

> Same skeleton, different clothes.

---

## 29. Behavior Layer (JavaScript – Interactivity)

### What It Is

* The **behavior layer** defines how users **interact** with the page

Handled by:

* **JavaScript**

### What JavaScript Can Do

* Create slideshows
* Handle form validation and submission
* Respond to clicks, hovers, scrolling
* Dynamically change content
* Animate elements
* Communicate with servers

### Example (Basic Interaction)

```html
<button onclick="alert('Hello!')">Click Me</button>
```

👉 This is **behavior**, not structure or style.

---

## 30. JavaScript Enhances User Experience

Using JavaScript allows:

* Rich, customized experiences
* Interactive web applications
* Dynamic updates without page reloads

Without JavaScript:

* Pages are static
* Interaction is minimal

---

## 31. The Skeleton–Clothing–Behavior Analogy (Very Important)

A powerful mental model:

* **HTML** → Skeleton / Framework 🦴
* **CSS** → Clothing & Appearance 👕
* **JavaScript** → Movement & Life ⚡

Why this analogy works:

* You can change clothes (CSS) without breaking bones (HTML)
* You can add movement (JS) without changing structure

This model helps avoid:

* Mixing responsibilities
* Writing messy code

---

## 32. Standards & Governance (W3C)

* Standards for **HTML and CSS** are maintained by:

  * **W3C (World Wide Web Consortium)**

Why standards matter:

* Consistent behavior across browsers
* Global collaboration
* Long-term web stability

---

## 33. Combining All Three Layers

When HTML + CSS + JavaScript work together:

* We create:

  * Beautiful
  * Dynamic
  * Interactive
  * User-friendly web experiences

### Example Concept

* HTML: form fields
* CSS: layout and colors
* JavaScript: validation + submission

Each layer has a **clear responsibility**.

---

## 34. Why This Matters in the Real World

Using these layers properly allows:

* Communication with users worldwide
* Access anytime, anywhere
* Tailored experiences for:

  * Customers
  * Stakeholders
  * End users

The web becomes:

* More engaging
* More useful
* More human-centered

---

## 35. Web Development as a Creative Field

Web development:

* Is both **technical and creative**
* Lets you:

  * Build useful tools
  * Create fun experiences
  * Solve real problems
  * Express creativity

👉 Making the web dynamic and beautiful is a **rewarding field**.

* Web page = 3 layers
* HTML → content & structure
* CSS → appearance
* JavaScript → interaction
* Separation of concerns
* Skeleton–clothes–behavior analogy
