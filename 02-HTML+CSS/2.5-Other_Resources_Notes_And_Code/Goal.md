# Reset vs Normalize (awareness)

## Goal

Master **Reset vs Normalize (awareness)** within **Phase 2 — HTML + CSS**. Depth requirements include: explaining concepts from first principles, applying them in code without reference materials, and diagnosing/debugging common CSS reset and normalization failures.

## Learning Objectives

* Explain the purpose and mechanics of CSS resets and normalization from first principles
* Apply reset and normalize strategies correctly without reference materials
* Choose between reset, normalize, or custom approaches based on project requirements
* Debug common issues arising from CSS resets and browser default styling conflicts

## Coverage

* Clear definitions of CSS resets vs normalization: philosophy, approach, and use cases
* Browser default styles: user agent stylesheets and cross-browser inconsistencies
* Reset strategies: aggressive resets, selective resets, and modern approaches
* Normalize.css approach: preserving useful defaults while ensuring consistency
* Mental models for how browsers apply default styles and how resets/normalize affect them
* Minimal demo code samples illustrating reset vs normalize effects
* Typical pitfalls and troubleshooting patterns (over-aggressive resets, accessibility issues, maintenance problems)

## Deliverables

* 1–2 page notes capturing core reset vs normalize concepts and decision criteria
* Runnable, minimal HTML/CSS examples demonstrating reset and normalize approaches in isolation
* Screenshots/GIFs of styling differences with and without reset/normalize

## Acceptance Criteria

* README with setup and run instructions (including how to test reset/normalize effects across browsers)
* Include tests where applicable (cross-browser testing, reset validation, normalize verification)
* Demonstrate understanding through working examples and accompanying documentation
