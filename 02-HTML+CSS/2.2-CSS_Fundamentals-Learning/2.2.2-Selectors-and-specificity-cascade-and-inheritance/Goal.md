# Selectors & specificity; cascade & inheritance

## Goal

Master **Selectors & specificity; cascade & inheritance** within **Phase 2 — HTML + CSS**. Depth requirements include: explaining concepts from first principles, applying them in code without reference materials, and diagnosing/debugging common selector and specificity failures.

## Learning Objectives

* Explain the purpose and mechanics of CSS selectors, specificity, cascade, and inheritance from first principles
* Apply various selector types and calculate specificity correctly without reference materials
* Understand cascade order and inheritance behavior to predict style application
* Debug common selector and specificity issues (unexpected style application, inheritance problems, cascade conflicts)

## Coverage

* Clear definitions of selector types: element, class, ID, attribute, pseudo-class, pseudo-element, combinators
* Specificity calculation: inline styles, IDs, classes, elements, and !important
* Cascade rules: source order, specificity, importance, and origin
* Inheritance behavior: inherited vs non-inherited properties, controlling inheritance
* Mental models for how browsers resolve style conflicts and apply inheritance
* Minimal demo code samples illustrating selector specificity and cascade resolution
* Typical pitfalls and troubleshooting patterns (specificity wars, inheritance confusion, cascade order issues)

## Deliverables

* 1–2 page notes capturing core selector, specificity, cascade, and inheritance concepts
* Runnable, minimal HTML/CSS examples demonstrating selector types and specificity calculations in isolation
* Screenshots/GIFs of browser DevTools showing computed styles and specificity resolution

## Acceptance Criteria

* README with setup and run instructions (including how to inspect computed styles and debug specificity)
* Include tests where applicable (specificity calculators, cascade testing, inheritance verification)
* Demonstrate understanding through working examples and accompanying documentation
