# Box model & box-sizing

## Goal

Master **Box model & box-sizing** within **Phase 2 — HTML + CSS**. Depth requirements include: explaining concepts from first principles, applying them in code without reference materials, and diagnosing/debugging common box model failures.

## Learning Objectives

* Explain the purpose and mechanics of the CSS box model from first principles
* Apply content-box and border-box sizing correctly without reference materials
* Calculate element dimensions considering margin, border, padding, and content
* Debug common box model issues (unexpected dimensions, layout breaks, overflow problems)

## Coverage

* Clear definitions of box model components: content, padding, border, margin
* Box-sizing property: content-box vs border-box behavior and implications
* Margin collapse: when and why it occurs, how to prevent it
* Width and height calculations in different box-sizing modes
* Mental models for how browsers calculate element dimensions
* Minimal demo code samples illustrating box model behavior and box-sizing differences
* Typical pitfalls and troubleshooting patterns (dimension miscalculations, margin collapse confusion, box-sizing inconsistencies)

## Deliverables

* 1–2 page notes capturing core box model concepts and box-sizing behavior
* Runnable, minimal HTML/CSS examples demonstrating box model calculations in isolation
* Screenshots/GIFs of browser DevTools showing box model visualization

## Acceptance Criteria

* README with setup and run instructions (including how to inspect box model in DevTools)
* Include tests where applicable (dimension calculations, box-sizing comparisons, margin collapse testing)
* Demonstrate understanding through working examples and accompanying documentation
