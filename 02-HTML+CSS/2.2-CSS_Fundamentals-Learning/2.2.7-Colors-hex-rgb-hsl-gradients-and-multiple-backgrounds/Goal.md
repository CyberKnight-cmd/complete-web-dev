# Colors: hex/rgb/hsl; gradients & multiple backgrounds

## Goal

Master **Colors: hex/rgb/hsl; gradients & multiple backgrounds** within **Phase 2 — HTML + CSS**. Depth requirements include: explaining concepts from first principles, applying them in code without reference materials, and diagnosing/debugging common color and background failures.

## Learning Objectives

* Explain the purpose and mechanics of CSS color systems and background properties from first principles
* Apply hex, RGB, HSL color formats and alpha transparency correctly without reference materials
* Create gradients and multiple background layers with proper syntax and positioning
* Debug common color and background issues (color format errors, gradient problems, background layering issues)

## Coverage

* Clear definitions of color formats: hex, RGB, HSL, named colors, and alpha transparency
* Color theory basics: hue, saturation, lightness, and practical application
* Gradient types: linear, radial, conic gradients with stops and positioning
* Multiple backgrounds: layering, positioning, sizing, and stacking order
* Mental models for how browsers interpret colors and render backgrounds
* Minimal demo code samples illustrating color formats and background techniques
* Typical pitfalls and troubleshooting patterns (color format mistakes, gradient syntax errors, background positioning issues)

## Deliverables

* 1–2 page notes capturing core color concepts and background techniques
* Runnable, minimal HTML/CSS examples demonstrating color formats and background effects in isolation
* Screenshots/GIFs of color rendering and gradient/background effects

## Acceptance Criteria

* README with setup and run instructions (including how to test color accuracy and background rendering)
* Include tests where applicable (color format validation, gradient testing, background layer verification)
* Demonstrate understanding through working examples and accompanying documentation
