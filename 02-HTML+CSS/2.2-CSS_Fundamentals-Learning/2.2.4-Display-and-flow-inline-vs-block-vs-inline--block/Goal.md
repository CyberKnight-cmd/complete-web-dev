# Display & flow; inline vs block vs inline-block

## Goal

Master **Display & flow; inline vs block vs inline-block** within **Phase 2 — HTML + CSS**. Depth requirements include: explaining concepts from first principles, applying them in code without reference materials, and diagnosing/debugging common display and flow failures.

## Learning Objectives

* Explain the purpose and mechanics of CSS display property and document flow from first principles
* Apply inline, block, and inline-block display values correctly without reference materials
* Understand normal document flow and how different display values affect element behavior
* Debug common display and flow issues (unexpected wrapping, alignment problems, spacing issues)

## Coverage

* Clear definitions of display values: inline, block, inline-block, none, and their behaviors
* Document flow: how elements are positioned in normal flow
* Inline formatting context: text flow, baseline alignment, width/height restrictions
* Block formatting context: stacking, margin collapse, width/height behavior
* Inline-block hybrid behavior: combining inline flow with block dimensions
* Mental models for how browsers lay out elements in different display modes
* Minimal demo code samples illustrating display property effects on layout
* Typical pitfalls and troubleshooting patterns (inline element sizing, block element centering, inline-block spacing)

## Deliverables

* 1–2 page notes capturing core display property concepts and flow behavior
* Runnable, minimal HTML/CSS examples demonstrating display value differences in isolation
* Screenshots/GIFs of layout behavior changes with different display values

## Acceptance Criteria

* README with setup and run instructions (including how to inspect element display properties)
* Include tests where applicable (display behavior testing, flow verification, layout validation)
* Demonstrate understanding through working examples and accompanying documentation
