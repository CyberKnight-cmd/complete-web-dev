# Debugging CSS with DevTools

## Goal

Master **Debugging CSS with DevTools** within **Phase 2 — HTML + CSS**. Depth requirements include: explaining concepts from first principles, applying them in code without reference materials, and diagnosing/debugging common CSS debugging failures.

## Learning Objectives

* Explain the purpose and mechanics of browser DevTools for CSS debugging from first principles
* Apply DevTools features to inspect, modify, and debug CSS effectively without reference materials
* Identify and resolve CSS issues using computed styles, box model visualization, and style inheritance
* Debug common CSS problems using systematic debugging approaches and DevTools features

## Coverage

* Clear definitions of DevTools features: Elements panel, Styles pane, Computed tab, Box Model viewer
* CSS inspection techniques: selector matching, specificity resolution, inheritance tracking
* Live editing: modifying styles, testing changes, copying computed values
* Debugging workflows: systematic problem identification and resolution strategies
* Mental models for how DevTools represent CSS application and cascade resolution
* Minimal demo code samples illustrating common debugging scenarios
* Typical pitfalls and troubleshooting patterns (specificity conflicts, inheritance issues, layout problems)

## Deliverables

* 1–2 page notes capturing core CSS debugging concepts and DevTools usage
* Runnable, minimal HTML/CSS examples with intentional bugs for debugging practice
* Screenshots/GIFs of DevTools debugging workflows and problem resolution

## Acceptance Criteria

* README with setup and run instructions (including how to use DevTools effectively for CSS debugging)
* Include tests where applicable (debugging exercises, problem identification scenarios, resolution verification)
* Demonstrate understanding through working examples and accompanying documentation
