# Print styles (intro)

## Goal

Master **Print styles (intro)** within **Phase 2 — HTML + CSS**. Depth requirements include: explaining concepts from first principles, applying them in code without reference materials, and diagnosing/debugging common print styling failures.

## Learning Objectives

* Explain the purpose and mechanics of CSS print styles and media queries from first principles
* Apply print-specific CSS rules and media queries correctly without reference materials
* Optimize content for print media with appropriate typography, layout, and color choices
* Debug common print styling issues (page breaks, color problems, layout inconsistencies)

## Coverage

* Clear definitions of print media: @media print, print-specific properties, page model
* Print optimization: typography choices, color considerations, layout adjustments
* Page control: page-break properties, orphans, widows, and page margins
* Print-specific units: inches, centimeters, points, and their appropriate usage
* Mental models for how browsers render content for print media
* Minimal demo code samples illustrating print style implementation
* Typical pitfalls and troubleshooting patterns (color printing issues, page break problems, layout overflow)

## Deliverables

* 1–2 page notes capturing core print styling concepts and optimization techniques
* Runnable, minimal HTML/CSS examples demonstrating print styles in isolation
* Screenshots/GIFs of print preview showing print-optimized layouts

## Acceptance Criteria

* README with setup and run instructions (including how to test print styles and preview print layouts)
* Include tests where applicable (print preview testing, media query validation, print optimization verification)
* Demonstrate understanding through working examples and accompanying documentation
