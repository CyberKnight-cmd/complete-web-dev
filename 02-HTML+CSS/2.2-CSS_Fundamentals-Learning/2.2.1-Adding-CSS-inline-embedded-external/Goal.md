# Adding CSS: inline, embedded, external (best practice)

## Goal

Master **Adding CSS: inline, embedded, external (best practice)** within **Phase 2 — HTML + CSS**. Depth requirements include: explaining concepts from first principles, applying them in code without reference materials, and diagnosing/debugging common CSS integration failures.

## Learning Objectives

* Explain the purpose and mechanics of CSS integration methods from first principles
* Apply inline, embedded, and external CSS correctly without reference materials
* Differentiate between CSS integration approaches and choose the best practice for each scenario
* Debug common CSS loading and integration issues (missing stylesheets, specificity conflicts, loading order problems)

## Coverage

* Clear definitions of CSS integration: inline styles, embedded stylesheets, external stylesheets
* Best practices: external CSS for maintainability, performance implications, caching benefits
* Loading order and cascade implications of different integration methods
* Mental models for how browsers parse and apply CSS from different sources
* Minimal demo code samples illustrating proper CSS integration
* Typical pitfalls and troubleshooting patterns (broken links, MIME type issues, specificity conflicts, performance problems)

## Deliverables

* 1–2 page notes capturing core CSS integration concepts and best practices
* Runnable, minimal HTML/CSS examples demonstrating all three integration methods in isolation
* Screenshots/GIFs of browser DevTools showing CSS loading and application

## Acceptance Criteria

* README with setup and run instructions (including how to inspect CSS loading and validate integration)
* Include tests where applicable (CSS validators, performance testing, loading verification)
* Demonstrate understanding through working examples and accompanying documentation
