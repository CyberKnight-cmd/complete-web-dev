# Typography: stacks, line-height, letter-spacing

## Goal

Master **Typography: stacks, line-height, letter-spacing** within **Phase 2 — HTML + CSS**. Depth requirements include: explaining concepts from first principles, applying them in code without reference materials, and diagnosing/debugging common typography failures.

## Learning Objectives

* Explain the purpose and mechanics of CSS typography properties from first principles
* Apply font stacks, line-height, and letter-spacing correctly without reference materials
* Create readable and accessible typography with proper spacing and fallbacks
* Debug common typography issues (font loading failures, spacing problems, readability issues)

## Coverage

* Clear definitions of typography properties: font-family, font-size, line-height, letter-spacing, word-spacing
* Font stacks: system fonts, web fonts, fallback strategies
* Line-height: unitless values, spacing calculation, vertical rhythm
* Letter and word spacing: readability optimization, accessibility considerations
* Mental models for how browsers render text and apply typography styles
* Minimal demo code samples illustrating typography property effects
* Typical pitfalls and troubleshooting patterns (font loading issues, line-height confusion, spacing inconsistencies)

## Deliverables

* 1–2 page notes capturing core typography concepts and best practices
* Runnable, minimal HTML/CSS examples demonstrating typography properties in isolation
* Screenshots/GIFs of typography rendering with different property values

## Acceptance Criteria

* README with setup and run instructions (including how to test font loading and typography rendering)
* Include tests where applicable (font fallback testing, readability validation, accessibility checking)
* Demonstrate understanding through working examples and accompanying documentation
