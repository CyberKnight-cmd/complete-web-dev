# Transitions (intro) & timing functions

## Goal

Master **Transitions (intro) & timing functions** within **Phase 2 — HTML + CSS**. Depth requirements include: explaining concepts from first principles, applying them in code without reference materials, and diagnosing/debugging common transition failures.

## Learning Objectives

* Explain the purpose and mechanics of CSS transitions and timing functions from first principles
* Apply transition properties and timing functions correctly without reference materials
* Create smooth animations and state changes with appropriate duration and easing
* Debug common transition issues (property conflicts, timing problems, performance issues)

## Coverage

* Clear definitions of transition properties: property, duration, timing-function, delay
* Timing functions: ease, linear, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out, cubic-bezier, steps
* Transition triggers: hover, focus, class changes, and state modifications
* Performance considerations: which properties to animate, hardware acceleration
* Mental models for how browsers interpolate values during transitions
* Minimal demo code samples illustrating transition effects and timing functions
* Typical pitfalls and troubleshooting patterns (property animation limitations, timing function misuse, performance problems)

## Deliverables

* 1–2 page notes capturing core transition concepts and timing function behavior
* Runnable, minimal HTML/CSS examples demonstrating transition effects in isolation
* Screenshots/GIFs of transition animations with different timing functions

## Acceptance Criteria

* README with setup and run instructions (including how to test transition performance and timing)
* Include tests where applicable (transition validation, timing function testing, performance monitoring)
* Demonstrate understanding through working examples and accompanying documentation
