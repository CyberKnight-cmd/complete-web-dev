# Borders, radius, shadows

## Goal

Master **Borders, radius, shadows** within **Phase 2 — HTML + CSS**. Depth requirements include: explaining concepts from first principles, applying them in code without reference materials, and diagnosing/debugging common border, radius, and shadow failures.

## Learning Objectives

* Explain the purpose and mechanics of CSS borders, border-radius, and box-shadow from first principles
* Apply border properties, rounded corners, and shadow effects correctly without reference materials
* Create visual depth and styling with proper border and shadow techniques
* Debug common border and shadow issues (radius clipping, shadow positioning, border conflicts)

## Coverage

* Clear definitions of border properties: width, style, color, and shorthand syntax
* Border-radius: uniform and individual corner rounding, elliptical curves
* Box-shadow: inset/outset shadows, multiple shadows, blur and spread values
* Visual design principles: depth, hierarchy, and accessibility considerations
* Mental models for how browsers render borders, radius, and shadows
* Minimal demo code samples illustrating border and shadow effects
* Typical pitfalls and troubleshooting patterns (radius inheritance, shadow stacking, border-box interactions)

## Deliverables

* 1–2 page notes capturing core border, radius, and shadow concepts
* Runnable, minimal HTML/CSS examples demonstrating border and shadow effects in isolation
* Screenshots/GIFs of visual effects with different border and shadow configurations

## Acceptance Criteria

* README with setup and run instructions (including how to test border rendering and shadow effects)
* Include tests where applicable (border validation, radius testing, shadow positioning verification)
* Demonstrate understanding through working examples and accompanying documentation
