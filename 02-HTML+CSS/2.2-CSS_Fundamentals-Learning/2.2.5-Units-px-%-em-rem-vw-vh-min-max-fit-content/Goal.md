# Units: px, %, em, rem, vw, vh; min/max/fit-content

## Goal

Master **Units: px, %, em, rem, vw, vh; min/max/fit-content** within **Phase 2 — HTML + CSS**. Depth requirements include: explaining concepts from first principles, applying them in code without reference materials, and diagnosing/debugging common unit and sizing failures.

## Learning Objectives

* Explain the purpose and mechanics of CSS units and sizing functions from first principles
* Apply absolute, relative, and viewport units correctly without reference materials
* Use min/max/fit-content sizing functions appropriately for responsive design
* Debug common unit and sizing issues (scaling problems, overflow, responsive breakage)

## Coverage

* Clear definitions of unit types: absolute (px), relative (%, em, rem), viewport (vw, vh, vmin, vmax)
* Unit behavior: how different units calculate and respond to context changes
* Sizing functions: min-content, max-content, fit-content, min(), max(), clamp()
* Responsive implications: which units work best for different scenarios
* Mental models for how browsers calculate dimensions using different units
* Minimal demo code samples illustrating unit behavior and sizing functions
* Typical pitfalls and troubleshooting patterns (em/rem confusion, viewport unit issues, sizing function misuse)

## Deliverables

* 1–2 page notes capturing core unit concepts and sizing function behavior
* Runnable, minimal HTML/CSS examples demonstrating unit calculations and responsive behavior in isolation
* Screenshots/GIFs of responsive behavior with different units and sizing functions

## Acceptance Criteria

* README with setup and run instructions (including how to test responsive behavior and unit calculations)
* Include tests where applicable (unit conversion testing, responsive validation, sizing function verification)
* Demonstrate understanding through working examples and accompanying documentation
