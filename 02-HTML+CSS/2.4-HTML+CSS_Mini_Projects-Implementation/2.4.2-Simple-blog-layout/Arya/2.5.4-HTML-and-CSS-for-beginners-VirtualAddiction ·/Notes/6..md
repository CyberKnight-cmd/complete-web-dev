# **Video 6: Nesting, Block vs Inline Elements, and Empty Elements**

---

## 119. Why These “Nuances” Matter

Before moving forward in HTML, we must clearly understand:

* **Nesting**
* **Block vs inline elements**
* **Empty (void) elements**

👉 These directly affect:

* Page layout
* Text flow
* Debugging errors

---

## 120. What Is Nesting in HTML?

* **Nesting** = placing one HTML element **inside another**
* Used when you want to style or affect **part of a larger block**

Example intent:

> “Eels have *horrible* eyesight”
> (where only *horrible* is emphasized)

---

## 121. Basic Nesting Example (Strong Inside Paragraph)

```html
<p>
  Eels have <strong>horrible</strong> eyesight.
</p>
```

What’s happening:

* `<p>` → parent element
* `<strong>` → child (nested) element
* Only the word *horrible* is bold

---

## 122. Parent, Child, Descendant (Terminology)

When nesting:

* Outer element → **parent**
* Inner element → **child**
* Anything inside → **descendant**

Example:

```html
<p>
  Text <strong>bold</strong>
</p>
```

* `strong` is a **child** of `p`
* `p` is the **parent**

---

## 123. Correct Nesting Order Rule (CRITICAL)

HTML elements must be:

* **Closed in the reverse order they were opened**

Mnemonic:

### **PHILO**

**P**reviously opened
**H**ighest
**I**n
**L**ast
**O**ut
→ *First In, Last Out (FILO)*

---

## 124. Correct vs Incorrect Nesting

✅ Correct:

```html
<p>
  <strong>Important</strong> text
</p>
```

❌ Incorrect:

```html
<p>
  <strong>Important</p>
</strong>
```

👉 Incorrect nesting breaks document structure.

---

## 125. Nesting Depth: Is There a Limit?

* ❌ No fixed limit
* ✅ You can nest many elements
* ⚠️ As long as:

  * Order is correct
  * Structure remains readable

---

## 126. Block-Level vs Inline Elements (Big Concept)

HTML elements fall into **two main categories**:

1. **Block-level elements**
2. **Inline elements**

Understanding this explains:

* Line breaks
* Layout behavior
* Why text moves the way it does

---

## 127. Block-Level Elements (Definition)

A **block-level element**:

* Starts on a **new line**
* Forces content before and after onto **separate lines**
* Forms a **visible block**

Think:

> Hard return / paragraph break

---

## 128. Common Block-Level Elements

Examples:

* `<h1>` – `<h6>`
* `<p>`
* `<div>`
* `<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`
* `<nav>`
* `<footer>`
* `<section>`

👉 Block elements are usually **structural**.

---

## 129. Block-Level Rules

* Block elements:

  * Can contain inline elements
  * Can contain other block elements
* ❌ Should **not** be placed inside inline elements

---

## 130. Inline Elements (Definition)

An **inline element**:

* Does **not** start on a new line
* Appears **within text**
* Only wraps **small parts** of content

Think:

> Text-level emphasis

---

## 131. Common Inline Elements

Examples:

* `<a>` (link)
* `<em>` (emphasis / italic)
* `<strong>` (importance / bold)
* `<span>`
* `<img>`

---

## 132. Inline Elements Do NOT Create Line Breaks

Example:

```html
<em>This is first</em><em>and this is second</em>
```

Result:

* Appears on **one line**
* No space unless you add one manually

---

## 133. Spacing with Inline Elements (Subtle but Important)

HTML does **not** auto-insert spaces.

You must add them:

```html
<em>This is first</em> <em>and this is second</em>
```

Space placement options:

* Inside text
* Between tags
* Before/after elements

---

## 134. Demonstrating Inline Behavior Clearly

```html
<em>This is first</em>, <em>and this is second</em>, <em>and this is third</em>
```

Result:

* All content appears on **one line**
* Because all elements are inline

---

## 135. Block + Inline Together (Very Common Pattern)

```html
<p>
  This is the fourth item,
  <em>and this is the fifth one</em>.
</p>
```

Result:

* Entire paragraph appears on its own line
* `<em>` only styles part of the text

Why?

* `<p>` → block-level
* `<em>` → inline

---

## 136. Why the Line Break Happens Here

* The **paragraph** forces a new line
* Inline elements inside it **do not**

👉 Block elements control layout
👉 Inline elements control emphasis

---

## 137. Quick Mental Rule

* **Block** → layout & structure
* **Inline** → text & emphasis

---

## 138. Empty Elements (New Category)

Not all elements:

* Have content
* Have closing tags

Some elements consist of **one tag only**.

These are called:

* **Empty elements**
* **Void elements**

---

## 139. Characteristics of Empty Elements

* No content inside
* Do not “wrap” anything
* Used to:

  * Insert
  * Embed
  * Break

---

## 140. Common Empty Elements

Examples:

* `<img />` → image
* `<br />` → line break
* `<hr />` → horizontal rule
* `<input />`
* `<meta />`
* `<link />`

⚠️ Memorize the common ones.

---

## 141. Self-Closing Syntax (Best Practice)

Empty elements are often written as:

```html
<br />
<img src="fish.jpg" />
```

Why:

* Clear
* XHTML-compatible
* Explicitly closed

---

## 142. `<br />` vs Paragraph (Important Difference)

* `<p>` → **hard return** (block-level spacing)
* `<br />` → **soft return** (line break only)

---

## 143. `<br />` Example in Context

```html
<p>
  This is the fourth item<br />
  and this is the fifth one
</p>
```

Result:

* Same paragraph
* Text moves to next line
* No extra spacing

---

## 144. Why `<br />` Is an Empty Element

* It does not surround content
* It simply **inserts a break**

Unlike:

```html
<p>content</p>
<em>content</em>
```

---

## 145. “Hugging Content” Rule

Most HTML elements:

* **Hug content** (wrap around it)

Empty elements:

* Do **not** hug anything
* Just perform an action

---

## 146. Terminology Recap (Exam-Friendly)

* **Tag** → written in code
* **Element** → rendered in DOM
* **Parent / Child / Descendant**
* **Block-level vs Inline**
* **Empty / Void element**

---

## 147. What You’ve Mastered in This Lesson

You now understand:

* Proper nesting rules
* FILO / PHILO principle
* Block vs inline behavior
* Why spacing behaves oddly
* Empty elements & `<br />`

These concepts are **non-negotiable HTML fundamentals**.

---

## 🔁 10-Second Recall Block (Video 6)

* Nesting = elements inside elements
* Close tags in reverse order (FILO)
* Block elements → new line
* Inline elements → same line
* Inline inside block = normal
* Block inside inline = ❌
* Empty elements have no closing tag
* `<br />` = soft line break
* `<p>` = hard break
