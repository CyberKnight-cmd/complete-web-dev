# **Video 5: HTML Elements, Tags, and Basic Structure (Hands-On)**

---

## 94. HTML Revisited: What It Is (One-Line Truth)

* **HTML is not a programming language**
* It is a **markup language** that tells browsers **how to structure content**

👉 HTML controls *structure and meaning*, not logic or behavior.

---

## 95. HTML Can Be Simple or Complex

* HTML scales based on:

  * Project size
  * Developer intent
* Same language can be used for:

  * A basic page
  * A full web application layout

---

## 96. HTML Is Made of Elements

* HTML consists of **elements**
* Elements are used to:

  * Enclose content
  * Wrap content
  * Mark up content

This marking tells the browser:

> “Treat this content in a specific way”

---

## 97. What HTML Elements Can Do

Using elements, we can:

* Turn text into a **paragraph**
* Make text **headings**
* Create **links**
* Emphasize or format text

Example:

```html
<p>Sea turtles think jellyfish are delicious.</p>
```

Here:

* The browser knows this is a **paragraph**

---

## 98. Tags vs Elements (Critical Distinction)

### Tags

* Syntax written in code
* Begin or end an element

### Elements

* Exist in the **DOM (Document Object Model)**
* What the browser actually renders

👉 Tags are **instructions**
👉 Elements are **results**

---

## 99. Case Sensitivity in HTML Tags

* HTML tags are **case-insensitive**
* These all technically work:

```html
<P>
<p>
<p>
```

### BUT — Best Practice 🚨

* Always write tags in **lowercase**

❌ Bad:

```html
<P>
<pR>
```

✅ Good:

```html
<p>
```

Why?

* Readability
* Consistency
* Older HTML versions **required lowercase**

---

## 100. Anatomy of an HTML Element (Must-Know)

An HTML element has **three parts**:

### 1️⃣ Opening Tag

```html
<p>
```

* Marks where the element starts

### 2️⃣ Content (Text Node)

```html
Sea turtles think jellyfish are delicious.
```

### 3️⃣ Closing Tag

```html
</p>
```

* Marks where the element ends

---

## 101. Complete HTML Element Example

```html
<p>Sea turtles think jellyfish are delicious.</p>
```

This full structure = **one HTML element**

---

## 102. Why Closing Tags Matter (Common Bug)

* Forgetting a closing tag can:

  * Break layout
  * Cause unexpected styling
  * Confuse the browser

🚨 One of the **most common beginner errors**

---

## 103. Start & End Tags Summary

* Most HTML elements:

  * Have **opening + closing tags**
* Closing tag:

  * Same name
  * Includes a forward slash `/`

Example:

```html
<h1>Heading</h1>
```

---

## 104. Empty (Self-Closing) Elements (Preview)

Some elements:

* Do **not** wrap content
* Close themselves

Examples:

```html
<br>
<img>
<hr>
```

👉 These are called **empty elements**
(We’ll study them in detail later.)

---

## 105. Moving to CodePen: Hands-On Practice

Steps:

1. Log into CodePen
2. Click **New Pen**
3. Collapse:

   * CSS pane
   * JavaScript pane
4. Focus only on:

   * HTML pane
   * Preview pane

---

## 106. Writing Your First Heading

```html
<h1>Welcome to Sea Life</h1>
```

What happens:

* Appears **large**
* Appears **bold**

This is **default browser styling**

---

## 107. Adding a Paragraph

```html
<p>Sea turtles are fascinating creatures.</p>
```

Browser behavior:

* Paragraph text is:

  * Smaller
  * Regular weight

👉 Browser applies **default styles**

---

## 108. HTML Headings Explained

HTML provides **six heading levels**:

```html
<h1>Largest</h1>
<h2></h2>
<h3></h3>
<h4></h4>
<h5></h5>
<h6>Smallest</h6>
```

Key points:

* All headings are bold
* Size decreases from `h1 → h6`

---

## 109. Heading Hierarchy (Very Important)

* `h1` → Main page title
* `h2` → Major section
* `h3` → Sub-section

❗ Do NOT choose headings by size
✅ Choose them by **importance**

---

## 110. Nesting & Indentation in CodePen

CodePen:

* Automatically indents nested content
* Helps you visually understand structure

Indentation ≠ required by browser
Indentation = **for humans**

---

## 111. Demonstrating a Common Error (Unclosed Tag)

Example mistake:

```html
<h3>Other creatures
<p>Eels, fish, and sharks.</p>
```

What happens:

* Paragraph appears bold
* Browser thinks `<p>` is inside `<h3>`

Why?

* `<h3>` was **never closed**

---

## 112. Fixing the Error

Correct version:

```html
<h3>Other creatures</h3>
<p>Eels, fish, and sharks.</p>
```

Result:

* Heading and paragraph render correctly

---

## 113. How Browsers Interpret Errors

* Browsers try to “guess” your intent
* They don’t throw visible errors
* This makes:

  * Debugging tricky
  * Structure errors dangerous

👉 Always close your tags.

---

## 114. Editing & Experimenting Safely

* CodePen allows:

  * Fast trial and error
  * Immediate feedback
* If something breaks:

  * Just fix the tag
  * Preview updates instantly

---

## 115. Cleaning Indentation Manually

If indentation looks wrong:

* Delete extra spaces
* Re-type tag correctly
* CodePen will realign it

---

## 116. Saving Your Work (Good Habit)

* Name your pen clearly
  Example:

```
02-05 HTML Elements Intro
```

* Click **Save**

This builds:

* Organized learning history
* Easy revision later

---

## 117. What This Lesson Focused On

You learned:

* What elements are
* What tags are
* Difference between tags & elements
* How headings & paragraphs work
* Why closing tags matter

---

## 118. Why Terminology Matters

Correct terms help you:

* Read documentation
* Ask better questions
* Debug faster
* Learn CSS & JS later

---

## 🔁 10-Second Recall Block (Video 5)

* HTML = markup, not programming
* Content wrapped in elements
* Tags start/end elements
* Lowercase tags = best practice
* Opening + content + closing
* Elements ≠ tags
* Unclosed tags break structure
* h1 → h6 define hierarchy
* Indentation aids readability
