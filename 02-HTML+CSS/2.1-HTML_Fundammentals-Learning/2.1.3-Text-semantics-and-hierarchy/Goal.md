# Text semantics & hierarchy (h1–h6, p, small, code)

## Goal

Master **Text semantics & hierarchy (h1–h6, p, small, code)** within **Phase 2 — HTML + CSS**. Depth requirements include: explaining concepts from first principles, applying them in code without reference materials, and diagnosing/debugging common text semantic and hierarchy failures.

## Learning Objectives

* Explain the purpose and mechanics of HTML text hierarchy from first principles
* Apply heading levels (h1-h6) correctly to create logical document outlines
* Use semantic text elements (p, small, code, em, strong) appropriately without reference
* Debug common text hierarchy issues (skipped heading levels, misused emphasis, improper code formatting)

## Coverage

* Clear definitions of heading hierarchy: h1-h6 structure, document outline algorithm
* Text semantics: paragraph structure, inline vs block elements, emphasis vs importance
* Code representation: inline code, code blocks, preformatted text
* Mental models for how screen readers and SEO tools interpret text hierarchy
* Minimal demo code samples illustrating proper text semantic usage
* Typical pitfalls and troubleshooting patterns (heading level skipping, div soup, misused small element, improper code escaping)

## Deliverables

* 1–2 page notes capturing core text semantic concepts and hierarchy principles
* Runnable, minimal HTML snippet demonstrating proper text hierarchy and semantic usage in isolation
* Screenshots/GIFs of document outline visualization, accessibility testing, and semantic validation

## Acceptance Criteria

* README with setup and run instructions (including how to inspect document outline and validate text semantics)
* Include tests where applicable (HTML validators, accessibility checkers, outline tools)
* Demonstrate understanding through working examples and accompanying documentation
