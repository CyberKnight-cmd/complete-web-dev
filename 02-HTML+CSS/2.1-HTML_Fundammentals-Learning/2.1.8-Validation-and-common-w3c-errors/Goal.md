# Validation & common W3C errors

## Goal

Master **Validation & common W3C errors** within **Phase 2 — HTML + CSS**. Depth requirements include: explaining concepts from first principles, applying them in code without reference materials, and diagnosing/debugging common HTML validation failures and W3C compliance issues.

## Learning Objectives

* Explain the purpose and mechanics of HTML validation from first principles
* Apply W3C validation standards correctly and fix common errors without reference
* Identify and resolve typical HTML validation issues systematically
* Debug complex validation problems using W3C validator tools and browser devtools

## Coverage

* Clear definitions of HTML validation: W3C standards, DOCTYPE declarations, well-formed markup
* Common validation errors: unclosed tags, invalid nesting, missing attributes, deprecated elements
* Validation tools: W3C Markup Validator, browser devtools, automated linting
* Mental models for how browsers handle invalid HTML and error recovery
* Minimal demo code samples illustrating proper validation practices
* Typical pitfalls and troubleshooting patterns (malformed HTML, accessibility violations, deprecated syntax, encoding issues)

## Deliverables

* 1–2 page notes capturing core validation concepts and error resolution strategies
* Runnable, minimal HTML snippet demonstrating proper validation practices in isolation
* Screenshots/GIFs of W3C validator usage, error identification, and resolution processes

## Acceptance Criteria

* README with setup and run instructions (including how to use W3C validators and fix common errors)
* Include tests where applicable (HTML validators, automated linting tools, validation scripts)
* Demonstrate understanding through working examples and accompanying documentation
