# Forms (foundation): inputs, labels, name/id mapping

## Goal

Master **Forms (foundation): inputs, labels, name/id mapping** within **Phase 2 — HTML + CSS**. Depth requirements include: explaining concepts from first principles, applying them in code without reference materials, and diagnosing/debugging common form structure and accessibility failures.

## Learning Objectives

* Explain the purpose and mechanics of HTML forms from first principles
* Apply form elements (input, label, textarea, select) correctly without reference
* Implement proper label-input associations using for/id and implicit labeling
* Debug common form issues (missing labels, improper name/id mapping, accessibility violations)

## Coverage

* Clear definitions of form anatomy: form element, input types, labels, fieldsets, legends
* Input-label relationships: explicit labeling with for/id, implicit labeling, accessibility implications
* Form controls: text inputs, checkboxes, radio buttons, select dropdowns, textareas
* Mental models for how screen readers and form validation interact with forms
* Minimal demo code samples illustrating proper form implementation
* Typical pitfalls and troubleshooting patterns (unlabeled inputs, duplicate IDs, improper fieldset usage, missing form attributes)

## Deliverables

* 1–2 page notes capturing core form concepts and accessibility principles
* Runnable, minimal HTML snippet demonstrating proper form structure and labeling in isolation
* Screenshots/GIFs of form accessibility testing, validation behavior, and screen reader interaction

## Acceptance Criteria

* README with setup and run instructions (including how to test form accessibility and validation)
* Include tests where applicable (accessibility checkers, form validators, usability testing tools)
* Demonstrate understanding through working examples and accompanying documentation
