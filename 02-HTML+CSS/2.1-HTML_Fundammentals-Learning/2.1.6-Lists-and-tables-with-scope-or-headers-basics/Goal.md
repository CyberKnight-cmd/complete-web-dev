# Lists & tables with scope/headers basics

## Goal

Master **Lists & tables with scope/headers basics** within **Phase 2 — HTML + CSS**. Depth requirements include: explaining concepts from first principles, applying them in code without reference materials, and diagnosing/debugging common list and table structure failures.

## Learning Objectives

* Explain the purpose and mechanics of HTML lists and tables from first principles
* Apply list types (ul, ol, dl) and table structure correctly without reference
* Implement accessible table headers, scope, and caption elements appropriately
* Debug common list and table issues (improper nesting, missing headers, accessibility violations)

## Coverage

* Clear definitions of list types: unordered, ordered, description lists, nested structures
* Table anatomy: table, thead, tbody, tfoot, tr, th, td, caption elements
* Table accessibility: scope attribute, headers attribute, summary techniques
* Mental models for how screen readers navigate lists and tables
* Minimal demo code samples illustrating proper list and table implementation
* Typical pitfalls and troubleshooting patterns (div-based fake lists, missing table headers, improper scope usage, complex table accessibility)

## Deliverables

* 1–2 page notes capturing core list and table concepts and accessibility principles
* Runnable, minimal HTML snippet demonstrating proper list and table usage in isolation
* Screenshots/GIFs of accessibility testing, table navigation, and structure validation

## Acceptance Criteria

* README with setup and run instructions (including how to test list and table accessibility)
* Include tests where applicable (accessibility checkers, HTML validators, table testing tools)
* Demonstrate understanding through working examples and accompanying documentation
