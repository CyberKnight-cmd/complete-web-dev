# Internationalization: lang, dir, entities

## Goal

Master **Internationalization: lang, dir, entities** within **Phase 2 — HTML + CSS**. Depth requirements include: explaining concepts from first principles, applying them in code without reference materials, and diagnosing/debugging common internationalization and character encoding failures.

## Learning Objectives

* Explain the purpose and mechanics of HTML internationalization from first principles
* Apply language attributes (lang), text direction (dir), and character entities correctly without reference
* Implement proper character encoding and entity handling for multilingual content
* Debug common internationalization issues (missing lang attributes, incorrect text direction, broken character entities)

## Coverage

* Clear definitions of internationalization: language codes, text direction, character encoding
* Language attributes: lang attribute usage, language subtags, accessibility implications
* Text direction: dir attribute, RTL/LTR handling, bidirectional text considerations
* Character entities: HTML entities, Unicode handling, special character encoding
* Mental models for how browsers and assistive technologies handle multilingual content
* Minimal demo code samples illustrating proper internationalization implementation
* Typical pitfalls and troubleshooting patterns (missing lang attributes, incorrect dir usage, broken entities, encoding issues)

## Deliverables

* 1–2 page notes capturing core internationalization concepts and implementation strategies
* Runnable, minimal HTML snippet demonstrating proper internationalization practices in isolation
* Screenshots/GIFs of multilingual testing, text direction behavior, and character entity rendering

## Acceptance Criteria

* README with setup and run instructions (including how to test internationalization features)
* Include tests where applicable (internationalization validators, character encoding checkers, multilingual testing tools)
* Demonstrate understanding through working examples and accompanying documentation
