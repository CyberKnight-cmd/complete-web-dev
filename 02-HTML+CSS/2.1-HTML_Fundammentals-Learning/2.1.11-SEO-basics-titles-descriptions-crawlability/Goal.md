# SEO basics: titles, descriptions, crawlability

## Goal

Master **SEO basics: titles, descriptions, crawlability** within **Phase 2 — HTML + CSS**. Depth requirements include: explaining concepts from first principles, applying them in code without reference materials, and diagnosing/debugging common SEO implementation failures.

## Learning Objectives

* Explain the purpose and mechanics of HTML SEO optimization from first principles
* Apply SEO-focused elements (title, meta description, headings) correctly without reference
* Implement crawlability best practices and structured markup appropriately
* Debug common SEO issues (missing titles, poor descriptions, crawling barriers, duplicate content)

## Coverage

* Clear definitions of SEO fundamentals: title tags, meta descriptions, heading hierarchy
* Crawlability factors: semantic HTML, internal linking, URL structure, canonical tags
* Search engine optimization: keyword placement, content structure, technical SEO basics
* Mental models for how search engines crawl, index, and rank web content
* Minimal demo code samples illustrating proper SEO implementation
* Typical pitfalls and troubleshooting patterns (duplicate titles, missing descriptions, poor heading structure, crawling issues)

## Deliverables

* 1–2 page notes capturing core SEO concepts and implementation strategies
* Runnable, minimal HTML snippet demonstrating proper SEO optimization in isolation
* Screenshots/GIFs of SEO testing tools, search result previews, and crawlability analysis

## Acceptance Criteria

* README with setup and run instructions (including how to test SEO implementations and validate crawlability)
* Include tests where applicable (SEO analyzers, crawling simulators, search result preview tools)
* Demonstrate understanding through working examples and accompanying documentation
