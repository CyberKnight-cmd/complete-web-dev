# HTML Document Structure & Semantics

## Goal

Master the foundations of **HTML Document Structure & Semantics** within **Phase 2 — HTML + CSS**. Depth requirements include: explaining concepts from first principles, applying them in code without reference materials, and diagnosing/debugging common structural and semantic failures.

## Learning Objectives

* Explain the purpose and mechanics of the HTML document tree from first principles
* Apply semantic HTML tags correctly and intentionally in production-grade markup
* Differentiate structural, grouping, and phrasing elements and use them without reference
* Debug common HTML structure and semantics issues (improper nesting, invalid layouts, accessibility regressions)

## Coverage

* Clear definitions of document structure: `<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, DOM hierarchy
* Semantics: sectioning elements, text-level semantics, landmark roles, accessibility implications
* Mental models for how browsers parse, normalize, and render HTML
* Minimal demo code samples illustrating correct semantic application
* Typical pitfalls and troubleshooting patterns (incorrect nesting, misuse of divs, broken outlines, ARIA misuse)

## Deliverables

* 1–2 page notes capturing core structural and semantic concepts
* Runnable, minimal HTML snippet demonstrating proper document structure and semantic usage in isolation
* Screenshots/GIFs of semantic validation, browser devtools inspection, and DOM visualization

## Acceptance Criteria

* README with setup and run instructions (including how to inspect the DOM and validate semantics)
* Include tests where applicable (HTML validators, linting rules, accessibility checks)
* Demonstrate understanding through working examples and accompanying documentation
