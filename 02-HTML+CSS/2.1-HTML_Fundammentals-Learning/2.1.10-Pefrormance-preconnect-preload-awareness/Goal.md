# Performance: preconnect, preload (awareness)

## Goal

Master **Performance: preconnect, preload (awareness)** within **Phase 2 — HTML + CSS**. Depth requirements include: explaining concepts from first principles, applying them in code without reference materials, and diagnosing/debugging common performance optimization failures.

## Learning Objectives

* Explain the purpose and mechanics of HTML performance optimization from first principles
* Apply resource hints (preconnect, preload, prefetch) correctly without reference
* Implement performance-focused HTML attributes and techniques appropriately
* Debug common performance issues (blocking resources, inefficient loading, missing optimization hints)

## Coverage

* Clear definitions of resource hints: preconnect, preload, prefetch, dns-prefetch
* Performance attributes: async, defer, loading="lazy", fetchpriority
* Critical resource optimization: above-the-fold content, render-blocking resources
* Mental models for how browsers prioritize and load resources
* Minimal demo code samples illustrating proper performance optimization
* Typical pitfalls and troubleshooting patterns (overuse of preload, incorrect resource hints, blocking JavaScript, unoptimized images)

## Deliverables

* 1–2 page notes capturing core performance concepts and optimization strategies
* Runnable, minimal HTML snippet demonstrating proper performance optimization in isolation
* Screenshots/GIFs of performance testing, resource loading analysis, and optimization validation

## Acceptance Criteria

* README with setup and run instructions (including how to test performance optimizations)
* Include tests where applicable (performance testing tools, resource analyzers, loading speed validators)
* Demonstrate understanding through working examples and accompanying documentation
