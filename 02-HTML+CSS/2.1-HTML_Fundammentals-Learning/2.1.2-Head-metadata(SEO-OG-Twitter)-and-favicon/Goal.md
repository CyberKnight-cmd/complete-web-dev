# Head metadata (SEO/OG/Twitter) & favicon

## Goal

Master **Head metadata (SEO/OG/Twitter) & favicon** within **Phase 2 — HTML + CSS**. Depth requirements include: explaining concepts from first principles, applying them in code without reference materials, and diagnosing/debugging common metadata and favicon implementation failures.

## Learning Objectives

* Explain the purpose and mechanics of HTML head metadata from first principles
* Apply SEO, Open Graph, and Twitter Card meta tags correctly without reference
* Implement favicon systems across different devices and browsers
* Debug common metadata issues (missing tags, incorrect syntax, broken social sharing, favicon loading failures)

## Coverage

* Clear definitions of essential meta tags: title, description, keywords, viewport, charset
* Social media metadata: Open Graph protocol, Twitter Cards, structured data basics
* Favicon implementation: multiple formats, sizes, device-specific icons
* Mental models for how search engines and social platforms consume metadata
* Minimal demo code samples illustrating proper metadata implementation
* Typical pitfalls and troubleshooting patterns (duplicate tags, incorrect Open Graph syntax, missing favicon formats, caching issues)

## Deliverables

* 1–2 page notes capturing core metadata concepts and implementation strategies
* Runnable, minimal HTML snippet demonstrating proper head metadata and favicon setup in isolation
* Screenshots/GIFs of social media preview testing, SEO validation tools, and favicon display across devices

## Acceptance Criteria

* README with setup and run instructions (including how to test social media previews and validate metadata)
* Include tests where applicable (metadata validators, social media debuggers, favicon checkers)
* Demonstrate understanding through working examples and accompanying documentation
