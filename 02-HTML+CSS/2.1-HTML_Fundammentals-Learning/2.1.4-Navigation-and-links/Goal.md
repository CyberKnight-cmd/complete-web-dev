# Navigation & links (rel, target, absolute vs relative)

## Goal

Master **Navigation & links (rel, target, absolute vs relative)** within **Phase 2 — HTML + CSS**. Depth requirements include: explaining concepts from first principles, applying them in code without reference materials, and diagnosing/debugging common navigation and linking failures.

## Learning Objectives

* Explain the purpose and mechanics of HTML links and navigation from first principles
* Apply link attributes (rel, target, href) correctly for different use cases without reference
* Differentiate between absolute and relative URLs and use them appropriately
* Debug common linking issues (broken paths, security vulnerabilities, accessibility problems)

## Coverage

* Clear definitions of link types: internal, external, anchor, download, email links
* Link attributes: rel relationships, target behaviors, security implications
* URL structures: absolute vs relative paths, protocol-relative URLs, fragment identifiers
* Mental models for how browsers handle link navigation and security
* Minimal demo code samples illustrating proper link implementation
* Typical pitfalls and troubleshooting patterns (broken relative paths, missing rel="noopener", improper target usage, inaccessible link text)

## Deliverables

* 1–2 page notes capturing core navigation concepts and link implementation strategies
* Runnable, minimal HTML snippet demonstrating proper link usage and navigation patterns in isolation
* Screenshots/GIFs of link testing, security validation, and accessibility checking

## Acceptance Criteria

* README with setup and run instructions (including how to test links and validate navigation)
* Include tests where applicable (link checkers, security scanners, accessibility validators)
* Demonstrate understanding through working examples and accompanying documentation
