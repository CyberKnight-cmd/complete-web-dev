# Images & media with accessible alt/captions

## Goal

Master **Images & media with accessible alt/captions** within **Phase 2 — HTML + CSS**. Depth requirements include: explaining concepts from first principles, applying them in code without reference materials, and diagnosing/debugging common image and media accessibility failures.

## Learning Objectives

* Explain the purpose and mechanics of accessible media implementation from first principles
* Apply alt text, captions, and media attributes correctly without reference
* Implement responsive images and modern media formats appropriately
* Debug common media accessibility issues (missing alt text, improper captions, broken responsive images)

## Coverage

* Clear definitions of media accessibility: alt text principles, caption requirements, screen reader considerations
* Image implementation: img element, srcset, sizes, picture element, lazy loading
* Media elements: video, audio, track elements, poster images, controls
* Mental models for how assistive technologies consume media content
* Minimal demo code samples illustrating proper accessible media implementation
* Typical pitfalls and troubleshooting patterns (decorative vs informative images, missing captions, improper srcset syntax, accessibility violations)

## Deliverables

* 1–2 page notes capturing core media accessibility concepts and implementation strategies
* Runnable, minimal HTML snippet demonstrating proper accessible media usage in isolation
* Screenshots/GIFs of accessibility testing, responsive image behavior, and media validation

## Acceptance Criteria

* README with setup and run instructions (including how to test media accessibility and validate implementations)
* Include tests where applicable (accessibility checkers, image validators, media testing tools)
* Demonstrate understanding through working examples and accompanying documentation
