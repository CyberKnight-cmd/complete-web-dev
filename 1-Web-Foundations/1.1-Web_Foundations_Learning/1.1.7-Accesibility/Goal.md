# Accessibility

## Goal
Master Accessibility (POUR) mindset & inclusive heuristics within Phase 1 — Web Foundations.

## Learning Objectives
- Explain POUR principles from first principles
- Apply accessibility concepts in code without reference
- Debug typical accessibility failure modes

## Coverage
- Clear definitions of POUR (Perceivable, Operable, Understandable, Robust)
- Mental models for inclusive design heuristics
- Minimal demo code examples
- Common pitfalls and accessibility violations

## Deliverables
- 1–2 page notes documenting accessibility principles
- Runnable code snippet demonstrating accessible implementations
- Screenshots/GIFs of accessibility tools and testing

## Acceptance Criteria
- Submit repo link with complete implementation
- README with setup/run instructions
- Include tests where applicable
- Demonstrate accessibility understanding through working examples
