# App Delivery

## Goal
Master App delivery: static vs dynamic vs SSR vs CSR vs SSG/ISR within Phase 1 — Web Foundations.

## Learning Objectives
- Explain different app delivery methods from first principles
- Apply delivery concepts in code without reference
- Debug typical delivery failure modes

## Coverage
- Clear definitions of static, dynamic, SSR, CSR, SSG, and ISR
- Mental models for different rendering strategies
- Minimal demo code examples
- Common pitfalls and performance considerations

## Deliverables
- 1–2 page notes documenting delivery methods
- Runnable code snippet demonstrating different approaches
- Screenshots/GIFs of implementation differences

## Acceptance Criteria
- Submit repo link with complete implementation
- README with setup/run instructions
- Include tests where applicable
- Demonstrate delivery understanding through working examples
