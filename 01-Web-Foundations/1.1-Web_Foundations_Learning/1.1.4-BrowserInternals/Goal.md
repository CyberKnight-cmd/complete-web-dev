# Browser Internals

## Goal
Master Browser internals: DOM, CSSOM, render pipeline, paint, composite within Phase 1 — Web Foundations.

## Learning Objectives
- Explain browser rendering from first principles
- Apply DOM/CSSOM concepts in code without reference
- Debug typical rendering failure modes

## Coverage
- Clear definitions of DOM, CSSOM, render pipeline, paint, and composite
- Mental models for browser rendering process
- Minimal demo code examples
- Common pitfalls and performance issues

## Deliverables
- 1–2 page notes documenting browser internals
- Runnable code snippet demonstrating rendering concepts
- Screenshots/GIFs of DevTools and rendering analysis

## Acceptance Criteria
- Submit repo link with complete implementation
- README with setup/run instructions
- Include tests where applicable
- Demonstrate browser internals understanding through working examples
